# What is it?


## Quick Overview

Neurochain is a blockchain project: understand a decentralized system that write a "log" called a blockchain. 
The "log" is:
* Public.
* It is not possible to change history.
* Yes, there is no cryptocurrency here yet. 


## The Bot

The bot is the Neurochain agent. The agents connect to each others in order to form a mesh network that allow: 
* Secure communication.
* Storing the "log" with sufficient resilience. 

Thanks to a smart [consensus](https://github.com/neurochain/WhitePaper), the bot coalition is able to safely write a unique log. Data written in the log comes 
from external applications to the blockchain. The main and first one is the [cryptocurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency). Maintaining a 
sustainable network requires rewarding the actors. The second reason for the cryptocurrency is to offer a payment method for other 
applications (e.g. filesharing, traceability).


# Build and Run 

## Targets: 

Officially supported now (in the CI): 
* debian:sid
* ubuntu:18.04
* fedora:28 

Best effort (we tried, it worked): 
* mac osX

Comming: 
* Windows X


## Requirements: 
* cmake >=3.0
* g++8/clang++7

Nothing else is needed (\o/). The rest of the dependencies will be downloaded and compiled by [hunter](http://www.hunter.sh/). 
It makes it easier to cover different platform by having the same version of the dependencies.

```bash
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

## Run 

```bash
./build/src/bot --listen 1337 
```
